- vector operations like SQL:
    quote: One observation I would make is that with vectorisation and
      subsetting, a lot of operations in R are more like SQL operations on
      databases than linear programming. If people can wrap their heads around
      that concept it often helps them he a good feel for why things are done
      in the way that they are.

- an environment having a scripting language:
    quote: R is more than a programming language. It is an interactive
      environment for doing statistics. I find it more helpful to think of R as
      having a programming language than being a programming language. The R
      language is the scripting language for the R environment, just as VBA is
      the scripting language for Microsoft Excel. Some of the more unusual
      features of the R language begin to make sense when viewed from this
      perspective.

- software environment for statistical computing:
    quote: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
      graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,
      Windows and MacOS.
